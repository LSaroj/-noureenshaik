Agile and scrum introduction  

 agile and scrum are very much familiar to us in life cycle of software development 

We use sprints here to develop the application and deliver it to the client 

                           

Dramatic Representation of scrum 

               Scrum master

Sprint Planning Foundations 

 It will take a quarter to create a module 

The quarter consists of 12 weeks 

3 weeks come in to one sprint 

So totally we do have 4 sprints in the first quarter to deliver the product to the client
